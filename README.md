# FR-Web-App-Payload
# OWASP Payload Search (static web app)

Lightweight static web app that lets you load a **local JSON** containing vulnerability entries and search payloads by vulnerability name. **This project does NOT include exploit payloads** — you must provide your own JSON file locally.

## Features
- Load JSON by file upload or paste
- Search by vulnerability name (partial/exact)
- Copy visible payloads, download current JSON
- Works fully client-side (no server)

## How to run locally
1. Save the repo to a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click) — no server required.
